Concept 1: Ethereal Artifact Constellation
Imagine the landing page as a vast, starlit void—minimalist black canvas with subtle gradients evoking the African night sky, symbolizing the timeless depth of cultural heritage. Using Three.js, we'd render a dynamic constellation of floating artifacts: simplified 3D models or point-cloud representations of key museum pieces (e.g., masks, sculptures) that gently orbit and pulse with a soft glow. No text-heavy intros or buttons clutter the view; instead, the user's cursor (or touch on mobile) acts as a gravitational pull—hovering draws an artifact closer, triggering a smooth Lenis-animated zoom-in transition where the model enlarges, rotates, and unfolds into a layered info reveal.

Interaction Flow: On approach, multilingual audio descriptions auto-play in a whisper-like narration (with pause/subtitle toggles via minimalist icons). QR integration could be hinted via a floating scanner icon that activates the device's camera for real-time artifact recognition, blending physical and digital worlds seamlessly.
Tech Stack Integration: Three.js for 3D rendering and particle effects (e.g., subtle dust motes representing cultural narratives); WebGL shaders for ethereal glows and depth-of-field blur to maintain minimalism. Lenis ensures buttery-smooth panning/scrolling if users "explore" the constellation by dragging.
Minimalist Essence: Zero sections or grids—pure experiential immersion. Accessibility via voice-over support and high-contrast modes. This concept democratizes access by turning the landing into a remote "virtual stargazing" of artifacts, encouraging exploration without overwhelming the senses.
Why It Fits the Hackathon: High innovation in blending AR-like QR scanning with 3D navigation; scalable for adding more artifacts; culturally impactful by abstracting heritage into a universal, contemplative experience.

Concept 2: Temporal Ripple Horizon
The page opens to a horizon line— a clean, infinite plane rendered in WebGL, with a minimalist color palette of earth tones fading into infinity, representing the continuum of African civilizations. No heroes or lists; instead, a subtle ripple effect (using Three.js water simulation shaders) emanates from the center, where a single, abstract timeline "wave" undulates based on user scroll or tilt (via device orientation API). As you interact, ripples reveal hidden layers: ghostly silhouettes of artworks emerge from the "water," morphing into interactive nodes that, when tapped, expand into fluid pop-ups with audio, video, and text descriptions.

Interaction Flow: Lenis-powered scrolling warps the horizon, simulating time travel—scroll forward for future cultural projections (e.g., user-generated contributions), backward for historical contexts. QR scanning integrates as a "ripple trigger": scan an artwork to send a digital wave across the page, centering it and unlocking multilingual content. Remote users can "dive" in via search or random discovery modes.
Tech Stack Integration: Three.js for the ripple physics and dynamic mesh deformations; WebGL for performant rendering on mobile/PC. Add subtle ambient audio (e.g., rhythmic drums fading in/out) tied to ripple intensity, with options for Wolof/English/French toggles.
Minimalist Essence: Pure gesture-based navigation—no menus, just intuitive scroll/tilt/hover. Focus on negative space to evoke reflection, with accessibility through screen-reader-friendly alt descriptions and keyboard navigation for ripples.
Why It Fits the Hackathon: Emphasizes fluidity and inclusivity (audio for visually impaired); technically feasible with prototypes in Figma + Three.js; high scalability for museum expansions, turning the landing into a meditative portal that extends the museum's reach digitally.

Concept 3: Whispering Veil Mosaic
Envision a veil-like overlay on a minimalist white canvas, where faint, translucent patterns (inspired by traditional African textiles) subtly shift and breathe via CSS animations enhanced by WebGL. The "veil" is a mosaic of interconnected fragments—each a low-poly 3D shard representing an artwork—that users can "part" with mouse drags or swipes, revealing deeper layers beneath. No conventional structure; the experience unfolds organically as shards connect like a puzzle, forming cultural narratives.

Interaction Flow: Dragging unveils audio-guided stories (multilingual, with waveform visuals for playback control). QR codes act as "keys": scanning one "unlocks" a shard, animating it to the forefront with video embeds or historical timelines. For remote access, a search whisper (voice input) parts the veil to specific artifacts.
Tech Stack Integration: Three.js for shard modeling and veil distortions (using displacement maps); Lenis for seamless drag momentum, mimicking fabric flow. Integrate Howler.js for spatial audio that pans based on shard position.
Minimalist Essence: Sparse visuals with high whitespace; interactions feel tactile yet unobtrusive. Ensure WCAG compliance with color-blind modes and ARIA labels for dynamic elements.
Why It Fits the Hackathon: Creative metaphor for "unveiling" culture; user-friendly for all devices; durable with offline caching for audio/text, promoting global rayonnement while keeping the core experience simple and profound.
