Hackathon ‚Äì Mus√©e des Civilisations Noires

1. Vision & Concept

The website/app should not just display content, but immerse visitors into the cultural narrative of the museum.
üëâ Think: A living digital museum that extends beyond Dakar, blending art direction, storytelling, and interactivity.

Creative north star:

‚ÄúEvery artifact has a story. Every visitor becomes a storyteller.‚Äù

A sleek, animated interface inspired by African design languages (textures, geometry, typography, patterns) but modernized (WebGL, GSAP, Framer Motion, smooth transitions).

UX that feels premium, but accessible: intuitive navigation, no overload.

2. UX/UI Experience Flows
a. On-Site Visitors

QR Scan ‚Üí Instant Story:

Visitor scans artifact QR code ‚Üí clean artifact page with text, audio narration, video context, images, and related works.

Accessible buttons for language switch (FR / EN / WO).

Audio narration: play, pause, transcript toggle.

b. Remote Visitors

Digital Museum Tour (home experience):

Interactive catalog of works (grid / gallery).

Smart search by theme, epoch, artist, material.

Featured journeys (curated ‚Äúpaths‚Äù through culture, e.g. Spirituality, Artisanat, H√©ros africains).

c. Inclusive Layer

Audio descriptions for visually impaired.

Minimalistic interface for older/non-tech audiences.

Offline caching / PWA capability (important for local context with limited connectivity).

3. Artistic & Motion Direction

Moodboard references:

Dark mode base (echoing the museum‚Äôs architecture) with gold/bronze accents ‚Üí luxury and timelessness.

African-inspired geometric patterns used sparingly as motion masks or section transitions.

Typography: mix of serif elegance (heritage) and sans-serif clarity (modern digital).

Motion principles:

Soft easing (GSAP/Framer Motion).

Dynamic transitions (fade-in artifacts, parallax on scroll).

Backgrounds subtly animated (particles/textures evoking dust, light beams, traditional fabric weaving).

Audio waveforms animating live when narration plays.

Hero interaction for landing page:

Rotating 3D artifact (WebGL / Three.js) that reacts to mouse movement/touch.

Accompanied by tagline: ‚ÄúEntrez dans l‚Äô√¢me des Civilisations Noires.‚Äù

4. Technical Approach
Stack Proposal

Frontend:

Next.js (App Router) + Tailwind + Framer Motion.

Three.js / React Three Fiber for 3D/WebGL elements.

GSAP for complex timeline-based animations.

Backend / CMS:

Strapi / Directus (headless CMS for artifacts, multilingual content).

Media hosting: Cloudinary (optimize images/videos).

Mobile / PWA:

Responsive-first + offline caching.

Optionally wrap in Expo for app submission.

Multilingual:

i18n integration (FR/EN/WO).

JSON-driven for hackathon simplicity.

Accessibility:

WCAG standards for contrast, text scaling.

Screen-reader tested.

5. Hackathon Deliverables (what to aim for in 48h)

Landing page prototype (wow-effect for judges) ‚Üí hero animation, intro, story of the project.

QR Scan demo ‚Üí one or two works with QR ‚Üí opens artifact detail page with multilingual + audio.

Catalog demo ‚Üí grid view + artifact modal.

Pitch deck with design system, future scalability, and impact narrative.

6. What Will Make It Win

Innovation: wow-factor animations, 3D elements, interactive storytelling (beyond just a CRUD app).

Cultural depth: use authentic design cues, highlight inclusivity (audio, Wolof).

UX clarity: simple, fluid, ‚Äúgrand public‚Äù friendly.

Scalable tech: headless CMS, responsive-first.

Pitch narrative: ‚ÄúWe bring the museum into every pocket, every home, every school.‚Äù

7. Suggested Hackathon Team Roles

UX/UI Designer: moodboard, Figma prototype, design system.

Frontend Dev (Next.js): structure, animations, responsive.

Motion/3D Dev: hero section + micro interactions.

Backend Dev: Strapi setup + CMS integration.

Pitch Lead: storytelling, impact framing, slides.

‚ú® End Result Vision (Awwwards-style):
A sleek, emotional, animated digital museum platform that makes Senegalese heritage shine globally ‚Äî an experience judges can‚Äôt forget after the demo.
